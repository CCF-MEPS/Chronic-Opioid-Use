The MEPS data files may be accessed at https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files.jsp.

Analysis of MEPS data was performed in R using the following code:

Collation of data from the inpatient stay files (HC-###D), prescribe medicine files (HC-###A), and full year consolidated data files (HC-###) into a combined file of unique admissions was performed using (Insert first markdown here).

Stastical analysis, generation of tables, and generation of figures was performed using (Insert second markdown here).


This analysis was performed on datafiles from MEPS survey years 2009 to 2016. Data labelling conventions do change from year to year which may cause errors to be encountered when using the above code with more recent survey years. Codebooks accompanying each datafile will specify new labelling conventions and should be consulted to troubleshoot any errors.
